Description: This package implements Logit-BART-BMA, a version of BART-BMA for binary outcomes. Estimated probabilities are averages of logistic functions of sums-of-trees. BART-BMA (Hernandez B, Raftery A.E., Parnell A.C. (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-017-9767-1>) is an extension to the original BART sum-of-trees model (Chipman et al 2010). BART-BMA differs to the original BART model in two main aspects in order to implement a greedy model which 
  will be computationally feasible for high dimensional data. Firstly BART-BMA uses a greedy search for the best split points and variables when growing decision trees within each sum-of-trees 
  model. This means trees are only grown based on the most predictive set of split rules. Also rather than using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BART-BMA uses a greedy implementation of Bayesian Model Averaging called Occam's Window 
  which take a weighted average over multiple sum-of-trees models to form its overall prediction. This means that only the set of sum-of-trees for which there is high support from the data
  are saved to memory and used in the final model.
